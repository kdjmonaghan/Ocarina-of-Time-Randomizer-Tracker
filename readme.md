# Ocarina of Time: Randomizer Item Tracker

This repository is a package for use when playing the [Ocarina of Time: Item Randomizer](https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer) - for further information on Ocarina of Time: Item Randomizer, please check out [Discord Channel](https://goo.gl/61RxPP) for this specific romhack.

This package is compatible with EmoTracker, a closed-source application created by [EmoSaru](https://github.com/emosaru) which can be downloaded through this [Discord Channel.](https://goo.gl/XG844K)

This package was inspired by [JRJathome's](https://github.com/JRJathome) own [Ocarina of Time Item Tracker](https://github.com/JRJathome/OoTRandoItemTracker) - but is suited to be a complete package that is structured a lot closer to how it appears in the video game for ease of use. 

Any issues or questions regarding this package, please feel free to contact me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/volvagia224) or on Discord at Volvagia#4747
