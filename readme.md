# Ocarina of Time: Randomizer Item Tracker

This repository is a package for use when playing the [Ocarina of Time: Item Randomizer](https://github.com/AmazingAmpharos/OoT-Randomizer) - for further information on Ocarina of Time: Item Randomizer, please check out [Discord Channel](https://goo.gl/61RxPP) for this specific romhack.

This package is compatible with EmoTracker, a closed-source application created by [EmoSaru](https://github.com/emosaru) which can be downloaded through this [Discord Channel.](https://goo.gl/XG844K)

This package was inspired by [JRJathome's](https://github.com/JRJathome) own [Ocarina of Time Item Tracker](https://github.com/JRJathome/OoTRandoItemTracker) - but is suited to be a complete package that is structured a lot closer to how it appears in the video game for ease of use. 

Any issues or questions regarding this package, please feel free to contact me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/volvagia224) or on Discord at Volvagia#4747

# Credits

##### Base Inspiration

* The base of this application was inspired by [JRJathome's](https://github.com/JRJathome)'s [Ocarina of Time Item Tracker](https://github.com/JRJathome/OoTRandoItemTracker) - I felt like his tracker was lacking things I personally would have liked, so, I created my own. Without using his tracker and not feeling satisfied with it, I doubt this one would exist.

##### Fonts

* The numerical representation font used for capacity amounts (Deku Nuts, Fairy Slingshot, Fairy Bow, Bombs, etc) was ripped from Ocarina of Time 3D by PwnzLPs.

#### Sprites / Equipment Icons

* The default sprite sheet used was ripped from Ocarina of Time by [KlydeStorm and can be downloaded from DeviantArt for Free](https://klydestorm.deviantart.com/art/Ocarina-of-Time-Icon-Pack-180384354) - I believe these are directly from the game itself, so, the icons themselves are copyright to Nintendo.

* The small icons used for the Spiritual Stones and Medallions were created by [ChaosMiles07 and can be downloaded from DeviantArt for free](https://chaosmiles07.deviantart.com/art/Ocarina-of-Thyme-tribute-546094518) - these were custom made, but are obviously referenced off the copyrighted image that belongs to Nintendo.
